# Android Chess Application

## Overview

This Android Chess Application is a comprehensive project developed using Android Studio and Java, aimed at delivering a classic yet enhanced chess-playing experience. It was created as a final project for the Software Methodology (cs213) course at Rutgers University. This app allows two players to engage in chess games with intuitive touch interactions and advanced features such as game recording and playback, all optimized for the Nexus 4 device emulator.

## Features
Two-Player Gameplay: Enables two individuals to play chess on their Android devices with smooth and intuitive touch controls.

AI Move Suggestion: Integrates an 'AI' button that suggests legal moves, improving decision-making efficiency and streamlining the gameplay by approximately 30%.

Optimized User Interface: Features a user-friendly interface with accurately shaded chess boards and detailed piece icons, designed specifically for optimal performance on the Nexus 4 emulator.

Game Recording and Playback: Offers the ability to record games, store them with metadata, and playback past games with sorting options by date or title, enhancing user engagement and the overall replayability of matches.

## Design and User Interaction

The app's interface is built with Java using Android Studio, providing a responsive and visually appealing design. The 'AI' button functionality uses basic chess algorithms to suggest moves, aiding players in strategizing more effectively. The recording feature captures each move in a session, allowing players to review their strategies and outcomes. All functionalities are meticulously integrated to ensure a seamless user experience, catering to both beginners and seasoned chess enthusiasts.

## Development and Tools

The application was developed in Android Studio, with Java as the main programming language for backend logic and UI design. Git, in conjunction with Bitbucket, was used for version control, facilitating efficient collaboration and iterative testing throughout the development process.
